All those things are tolerable only when playing with friends. Playing this solo for me and going through all things mentioned above feels unenjoyable and frustrating. There are games that just do things better than this.']",Not Recommended,372.7,77

Yet there you are week after week plowing away because trying to find something else is not just more work, it's doesn't seem to have the gratification that PUBG can have. Sure it's not always gratifying. Sometimes it's downright abusive. But when it is good, it is so much better than anything else. Sure you could find that safe, sane game that will treat you the way you want to be treated. And who knows it might even work out. But a part of you will always yearn for the feeling that PUBG gives you. You will yearn for that feeling and eventually you'll be back for it. Because we both know you can't get it anywhere else.

The game was alot simplier and overall just more fun with far less issues in beta, which is where most of my hours come from. I would prefer to go back to beta, so that there isn't the feeling of a company so desperate to squeeze every bit of money out of this game as they could. (They promised never to add microtransactions, which they did. They also added items which are only unlocked for a set amount of time before being revoked.) I play in the EU and almost never encounter any cheaters, but i can't speak for asian or NA players who apparently regularly encounter chinese hackers. However, as i stated at the beginning, the game does not deserve as much hate as it currently gets. The optimization is far better than it ever has been (i have a mid spec pc and can run this on high/ultra at 100fps+) They have improved the UI and added alot of QOL features which can be toggled on/off. They massively fixed the dsync that everyone constantly complained about (for the most part, you still get the odd instance but it is rare now.) I also more or less never experience any game crashes now either, which used to/still is problem for some, although saying that it isn't anywhere near as bad as it used to be. The overall feeling of the game is that it's good, feels fun to play, is quite smooth and entertaining, especially with a group of friends. But there is always the underlying feeling of a company that just doesn't care about the community, as they ignore/put off fixing the main issues of the game as they would rather add new weapon/player cosmetics. And as i stated, some of these expire once aquired. You can't help but feel dissapointed in PUBG, especially as someone who put so much time into the beta. I played it when it was incredibly unoptimized, experienced frequent crashes, put up with countless numbers of bugs. Each new update greatly improved the game, and pubg's number rised. I thought it was going to be one of the most popular games on steam for quite a long time. Until the release of 1.0, and ever since then, i just continued to lose faith in bluehole. I would reccommend trying it out again if you played it before but decided to take a break. However, as for purchasing, i'm not entirely sure. I think you should make your own mind up."", '', 'TL;DR:', ""It's still a fun game, especially with a group of friends, not as bad as almost everyone claims, and is far more polished than it was in beta.

257,December 2,"[""While i would agree with many that the game has only gotten worse since the release of 1.0, the game doesn't deserve as much hate as it gets now. The game was alot simplier and overall just more fun with far less issues in beta, which is where most of my hours come from. I would prefer to go back to beta, so that there isn't the feeling of a company so desperate to squeeze every bit of money out of this game as they could. (They promised never to add microtransactions, which they did. They also added items which are only unlocked for a set amount of time before being revoked.) I play in the EU and almost never encounter any cheaters, but i can't speak for asian or NA players who apparently regularly encounter chinese hackers. However, as i stated at the beginning, the game does not deserve as much hate as it currently gets. The optimization is far better than it ever has been (i have a mid spec pc and can run this on high/ultra at 100fps+) They have improved the UI and added alot of QOL features which can be toggled on/off. They massively fixed the dsync that everyone constantly complained about (for the most part, you still get the odd instance but it is rare now.) I also more or less never experience any game crashes now either, which used to/still is problem for some, although saying that it isn't anywhere near as bad as it used to be. The overall feeling of the game is that it's good, feels fun to play, is quite smooth and entertaining, especially with a group of friends. But there is always the underlying feeling of a company that just doesn't care about the community, as they ignore/put off fixing the main issues of the game as they would rather add new weapon/player cosmetics. And as i stated, some of these expire once aquired. You can't help but feel dissapointed in PUBG, especially as someone who put so much time into the beta. I played it when it was incredibly unoptimized, experienced frequent crashes, put up with countless numbers of bugs. Each new update greatly improved the game, and pubg's number rised. I thought it was going to be one of the most popular games on steam for quite a long time. Until the release of 1.0, and ever since then, i just continued to lose faith in bluehole. I would reccommend trying it out again if you played it before but decided to take a break. However, as for purchasing, i'm not entirely sure. I think you should make your own mind up."", '', 'TL;DR:', ""It's still a fun game, especially with a group of friends, not as bad as almost everyone claims, and is far more polished than it was in beta.

Another thing is that this game isn?€?t an addictive game. Sometimes you go into a couple games and you?€?re destroying everyone, and you have to keep playing and it?€?s amazing. Other times you go into a couple games and you lose and want to stop playing. I go through phases with this game, but I always keep coming back and I have improved tons since I started. Finally, the last thing you should know is that this is a largely squad or duo based game. I mostly play solos, but when I play duos and squads with my friends it?€?s the most funny, most hilarious game you?€?ve ever played. Random duos or squads I don?€?t recommend, because of the high number of Chinese players, although the devs are working on better matchmaking at the moment, so hopefully it?€?s just a matter of time. They?€?ve tried a method of ping-based matchmaking, although it didn?€?t go exactly as planned and has caused some server issues for OCE players unfortunately.', '', 'Overall, PUBG is a great game, and the devs are much better than people make them out to be, so I definitely recommend it????.']",Recommended,209.8,19

PUBG right now is probably the best battle royale out right now. Sure, it has it?€?s bugs, it has paid skins, it has hackers, and it?€?s got some work to do, but the developers overall are pretty good. While the bugs do exist, honestly I?€?ve never noticed an abnormally large amount of bugs, exception of the vehicles which have hilariously bad physics. The paid skins are annoying, and I don?€?t like them, especially when you spend your BP on a loot crate and you need to buy a key, so you end up wasting your BP, but after all it?€?s only cosmetics, and as long as it?€?s not pay to win I can?€?t complain too much.

Anyways, because of the sweaty player base, this game takes a lot of practice and learning to get good at and after 209 hours I?€?m still only barely decent.

I mostly play solos, but when I play duos and squads with my friends it?€?s the most funny, most hilarious game you?€?ve ever played.
